# Service Novigrad
Service Novigrad created by GitHub Classroom


This is an Android app that I built for a school project. I managed to familiarize myself with Android Studio using Java.
The app replicates a big organization, like a city or a country and helps by offering services.
Clients can login to see what are their available services (driving license, health card, etc.) and apply for one of them.
Employees can approve requests, and manage the branche were they work. Finally, administrator have almost all of the rights,
and can control pretty much everything there is.
              
See the [servicenovigrad.json](servicenovigrad.json) file to try the app with logins and services.
